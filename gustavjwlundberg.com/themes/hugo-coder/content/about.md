Born and raised in Link√∂ping, Sweden, I have been an expat Swede since the age of six, and have spent most of my formative years living in the United States with a brief stint in Austria.

Driven by my interest in human behavior and cognition, I completed my undergraduate degree in Psychology and Sociology at the University of Iowa.

With the goal of conducting research and furthering my education, I attended New York University, and completed my M.A. in Psychology, specializing in Social Psychology and Social Neuroscience.

Currently I am working as a data anlyst in the Greater New York Metropolitan Area.
